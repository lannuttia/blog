<h1>About Me:</h1>

<h2>My Professional History:</h2>
<p>
  I'm a software engineer working remotely out of the greater Fayetteville
  Arkansas area. I graduated from the University of Arkansas in December of
  2016 with my Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering. Right out of
  college I worked at L3Harris Technologies in Greenville Texas. While there,
  I discovered my love of Software. I did everything from DSP algorithm
  development, to web service development, to FE web development, and eventually
  to CI/CD pipeline development. After several years of working there, I found a
  job working a J.B. Hunt Transportation. While at J.B. Hunt, I have been working
  on Spring Boot and Quarkus applications for the
  <a href="https://www.jbhunt.com/our-technology/carrier-360.html">Carrier 360</a>
  platform.
</p>

<h2>My Hobbies:</h2>
<p>
  I love dabbling in Linux and BSD system administration, and ricing my own Linux
  desktop. I also love playing games like Factorio, Feed the Beast (Minecraft with
  mods), and the occasional shooter like Doom. Despite my love of gaming, I do not
  own a Windows or Mac computer. All of my computers and networking equipment runs
  some form of BSD or Linux.
